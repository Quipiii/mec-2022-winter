# Housekeeping

- In terms of reviewing and giving feedback on projects, your team's git commit history is *fair game* for us to look at and take into consideration. We will see **who** committed **what** and **when**, taking into consideration not just quantity of commits but also quality of commits. If you are ever concerned about unequal contributions among your team, don't worry. The commit history will tell us. This is also analogous to the work environment. Team members are often evaluated on their contributions to assigned tasks.

- *Caveat*: we also recognize that there are some kinds of work that aren't represented in the commit history, such as research. However, we use commit histories as one of a few ways to evaluate your progress.

- *Tutoring* is available: [https://airtable.com/shr3SJivhAkq64e36](https://airtable.com/shr3SJivhAkq64e36)
