# Tag Attributes 1/2

You can pass extra information to tags using attributes, much like you would pass arguments to a function. These attributes happen *in the opening tag only* and between the `<tagname` and corresponding `>` parts and take the form of `key="value"` Here's an example:

`<img src="https://bit.ly/38kh8Lg" />`

# Tag Attributes 2/2

Attributes are optional, but certain tags need them to be of any practical use. An `<img />` tag without a `src` will not display anything. For other tags, attributes are enhancing. eg:

`<input></input>`  
`<input type="checkbox"></input>`

Tags can have unlimited attributes. Only a handful of attribute key names are valid and mean something; invalid attributes are recorded but generally ignored. Attributes *never* appear in the closing tag.

# Generalized Forms of HTML

```
<tagname attr1="value1" attr2="value2"></tagname>
<tagname>children</tagname>
<tagname attr1="value1" />
<tagname1>
  <tagname2>
    children>
  </tagname2>
</tagname2>
```
