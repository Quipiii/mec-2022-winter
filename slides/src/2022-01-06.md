- What is HTML?
- Why should we learn it?
- What is the general syntax pattern of HTML?
- What is nesting in terms of HTML?
- What makes HTML valid or invalid?

# Tag Attributes 1/2

You can pass extra information to tags using attributes, much like you would pass arguments to a function. These attributes happen *in the opening tag only* and between the `<tagname` and corresponding `>` parts and take the form of `key="value"` Here's an example:

`<img src="https://bit.ly/38kh8Lg" />`

---

# Tag Attributes 2/2

Attributes are optional, but certain tags need them to be of any practical use. An `<img />` tag without a `src` will not display anything. For other tags, attributes are enhancing. eg:

`<input></input>`  
`<input type="checkbox"></input>`

Tags can have unlimited attributes. Only a handful of attribute key names are valid and mean something; invalid attributes are recorded but generally ignored. Attributes *never* appear in the closing tag.

# Generalized Forms of HTML

```
<tagname attr1="value1" attr2="value2"></tagname>
<tagname>children</tagname>
<tagname attr1="value1" />
<tagname1>
  <tagname2>
    children>
  </tagname2>
</tagname2>
```

# The HTML Specification

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- this is an HTML comment -->
    <!-- this section contains meta information about the page -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- this section contains everything to be rendered and shown on the web browser -->
  </body>
</html>
```

# CSS
## Bringing life to HTML

---

# What is it?

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) guides how HTML tags look and behave on the screen. With enough work, it can produce intricate UI/UX by itself alone. With very large and/or long projects and/or very large teams, CSS provides an easy way to manage the look and feel of a webapp with consistency.

---

# Where does it go?

You can write CSS in separate .css files as well as straight between `<style>` `</style>` tags embedded directly into HTML. For our demo and assignment today, we'll be embedding them into the HTML for simplicity. In the real world, it's not uncommon to have a dozen or more external CSS files, allowing the code to be better maintained.

---

# Example

```
<style>
  .profile_card{
    width: 40%;
	font-family: Roboto, Arial, monospace;
    border: 1px solid darkblue;
  }

  .profile_photo{
    border-radius: 50%;
  }
</style>
```

---

# Generalized Syntax

A CSS rule looks like incredibly similar to JS object key-value pairs:

`font-size: 12px;`

The restraints are a bit more relaxed. One or more rules are combined with a `selector` to produce a `rule-set`:

`
selector {
  key1: value1;
  key2: value2;
}
`

# CSS Selectors

Selectors determine which HTML tags a set of rules applies to and have their own syntax. Generally, you will have a `tag` with or without modifiers. Here are a few examples:

```
div { /* rules */ }
.centered { /* rules */ }
div.centered { /* rules */ }
#main_article { /* rules */ }
div < h1 { /* rules */ }
div p { /* rules */ }
```

---

# CSS classes 1/2

One incredibly important feature of CSS is `classes`. This let's you apply rulesets to different groups of tags, differentiating them by their **role** instead of their **tag**. To start, you add a `class` attribute to the HTML tags you are differentiating:

```
<img src='/* url */' class='customer_profile' />
<img src='/* url */' class='product main' />
```

---

# CSS classes 2/2

There are a few ways to write selectors to target these img tags:

```
.customer_profile {/*rules*/}
img.customer_profile {/*rules*/}
.product {/*rules*/}
.main {/*rules*/}
img.product.main {/*rules*/}
```

# References

CSS is also exhaustive, like HTML. Here is a full guide for reference:

# Forking Repos

Sometimes, you will want to make a significant departure from a project's code base, you can do a `fork`. It is kind of like branching but much more severe. Chances are that you are not looking to merge your changes back into the original code base.

Let's fork!
