# Review

- What is a git branch?
- Why do we use branches?
- What is the workflow for branching?
- What is one naming convention for your branches?
- What is a pull request?
- Why do we use pull requests?

---

# git branch workflow review

- To start a new branch: `git branch checkout -b name_of_new_branch`
- To switch between branches: `git branch checkout name_of_existing_branch`
- To check branches: `git status` or `git branch`
- Remember to specify your branch when pushing/pulling
  - `git push origin name_of_branch`
  - `git pull origin name_of_branch`

# HTML
## The backbone of web technologies

---

# What does it do?

HTML organizes information in a tree-like structure so that web browsers can display it intelligently. It provides minimal aesthetics and interactivity, instead relying on JS and CSS to produce what we expect from a modern website.

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. As the acronym suggest, it is purely a markup language used to describe the information. It is not a fully fledged programming language, yet is often used alongside them.

**Still**, you need to learn its syntax.

---

# HTML Syntax

The core of HTML is the **element**, sometimes called **tag**. They look like this:

`<bold>Beagles are the best breed of dog!</bold>`  
`<button>send</button>`

Here, the `<bold>` and `<button>` are opening tags (also sometimes just called tags), with their corresponding closing `</bold>` and `</button>` tags. Tags apply certain characteristics to everything between their open and closing tags. A tag's contents are called its children.

Nearly all tags have opening and closing tags, but some have a special, combined syntax. eg: `<br />`

---

# Nesting and Tree Structure

There are no restrictions to what a tag's children can be. They can be text, nothing, or other tags. They are processed in a *stack like* fashion, where all of a tag's children *must* have their closing tags appear before its own closing tag appears. Here's a valid example of nested tags:

---

# Valid Example

```
<div>
  <p>
    Dear Mr. Potter,
  </p>
  <p>
    Congratulations! You are wizard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prof. Dumbledore
  </p>
</div>
```

---

# Thumb Poll 1/2

Is this valid HTML?

```
<article>
  <div>
    <p>
      I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart: I am, I am, I am.
    </div>
  </p>
</article>
```

---

# Thumb Poll 2/2

What about this?

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Average
    </td>
    <td>
      32,450
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

```

# HTML reference

There are over 100 different HTML tags, which is beyond our scope to go through exhaustively. Here is the complete list:

In practice, you'll only be using a few dozen most commonly. Here is a cheat sheet for the most commonly used ones:

# Pause for Questions

# Tag Attributes 1/2

You can pass extra information to tags using attributes, much like you would pass arguments to a function. These attributes happen *in the opening tag only* and between the `<tagname` and corresponding `>` parts and take the form of `key="value"` Here's an example:

`<img src="https://bit.ly/38kh8Lg" />`

---

# Tag Attributes 2/2

Attributes are optional, but certain tags need them to be of any practical use. An `<img />` tag without a `src` will not display anything. For other tags, attributes are enhancing. eg:

`<input></input>`  
`<input type="checkbox"></input>`

Tags can have unlimited attributes. Only a handful of attribute key names are valid and mean something; invalid attributes are recorded but generally ignored. Attributes *never* appear in the closing tag.

---

# Generalized Forms of HTML

```
<tagname attr1="value1" attr2="value2"></tagname>
<tagname>children</tagname>
<tagname attr1="value1" />
<tagname1>
  <tagname2>
    children>
  </tagname2>
</tagname2>
```

---

# The basic form of an HTML page

```
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- this is an HTML comment -->
    <!-- this section contains meta information about the page -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- this section contains everything to be rendered and shown on the web browser -->
  </body>
</html>
```

---

# Why is HTML important to us?

- It's the backbone of the web. Every website is built on top of it. Go see!
- ReactJS uses JSX syntax, which borrows heavily from JS and HTML syntax.
