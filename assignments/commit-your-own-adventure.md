# TTP 2022 Winter Assignment 1: Choose Your Own Adventure

## Purpose

To practice fundamental git and GitHub workflows in a non-coding environment.

## Background

Choose Your Own Adventure is a series of books published in 80s and 90s where the story is broken down into segments and the reader is given choices to control how they navigate through these segments. Each book had a multitude of different endings, each achievable by a different unique combination of choices. This led to a high level of re-readability and thus became wildly popular when video game consoles and personal computers were still rare.

## Task

You are going to produce a miniature version of a Choose Your Own Adventure story, using git and GitHub to construct it collaboratively with your teammates. You will write a segment of the story, including either a number of options to choose or a unique ending to the story. Use the format below for each section:

```
## [start]
You arrive at the archery competition disguised as a peasant.
No one would ever recognize you; even if they could, the dirty
blanket you have wrapped around your head stinks so much that
no one would come within 10 feet of you. The crowd is bustling
but you have your eyes fixed on the king. As he steps up to make
opening remarks, your chance for revenge takes shape. Do you:

**[1a]** Yell over the noise and call him out.
**[1b]** Hold your tongue until you can get closer.

---

## [1a]
You shout, "I am the daughter of Avalon! I'm here to reclaim
my kingdom!" Unfortunately, the king had been expecting you
and royal guards appear next to you before you can know it.
They lock you in shackles in the deepest corner of the dungeon.

**[end]**

---

## [1b]

The dastardly king finds his seat and waves for the festivities to
start. Drums beat wildly and the crowd is yelling; what, exactly,
you can't make out but all that you know is it ecstatic. A guard
hands you a longbow and a 3 arrows.

**[2a]** Grab them and take aim down the field.
**[2b]** Shake your head apologetically and melt back into the crowd.


```

Have one student create a new repo and start the story. Don't forget to invite the other students as collaborators. Then, use `git pull`, `git add`, `git commit -m`, and `git push` to take turns to add segments to the story.

Remember, you don't always have to add to the story. You can go back and rewrite a previous section. You can fix typos or correct errors. But each of these is a git commit.
