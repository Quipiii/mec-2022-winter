# TTP 2022 Winter Project 6: Javascript Scales

## Purpose

To practice working with Javascript at different levels of engagement.

## Task

Download one of the following files, depending on your level of comfort with Javascript:

- [javascript-scales-foundational.js](javascript-scales-foundational.js)
- [javascript-scales-intermediate.js](javascript-scales-intermediate.js)

Copy it to a new repo. The file will have a series of mini tasks for you to accomplish, presented as empty functions. *Do not rename the functions or change the arguments.* To the best of your ability, complete the function to accomplish the task.

If you need to, you can create other helper functions and/or use packages. *If you are submitting javascript-scales-intermediate.js, you will need to also include a package.json and .gitignore file.*
