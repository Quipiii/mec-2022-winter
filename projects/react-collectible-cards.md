# TTP 2022 Winter Project 7: React Trading Cards

## Purpose

To practice using libraries and custom components in React

## Task

Imagine that you are creating new trading cards for a game, television show, movie, or book that interests you. Your task is to build a single page React website that shows off *at least 3 trading cards* of your own design. Look at existing trading cards and determine the general structures / patterns in cards to help you decide on what components you will need to set up. You can use Jamboard or something similar to sketch out your ideas before implementing them in code.

## Requirements

You need to create *at least 3 trading cards* using *at least 3 custom components* and *at least 3 components* from a react library, like Material UI.

## Review

You will likely need to brush up on JS Objects and Arrays to keep up with standard coding practices. Here are some tutorials:
