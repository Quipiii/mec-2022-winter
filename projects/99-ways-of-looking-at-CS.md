# TTP 2022 Winter Project 5: 99 Ways of Looking at CS

## Purpose

To pull together all of the skills that we have learned so far and integrate them into a single project.

To begin to understand and practice project management skills.

## Task

As a team, you are going to build a brochure website for a branch of computer science. Choose something that interests all / most of your team members.

There needs to be **at least 1 html page per team member**, with each page focusing on a particular aspect of that branch. Here are some suggestions for aspects to cover:

- History
- Current Developments
- Notable People Involved
- Real World Examples
- Sub Branches
- Intro Page with links to everything else

Create a single repo for all team members. Use feature branches to track changes and contributions, using branch names like `chin-responsive-images` and `chin-footer`.

Select one member of your team to act as the *project manager*. Their responsibility is to manage Pull Requests, track progress / obstacles, and host stand up meetings. This role is best suited to someone who is detail oriented and has good time management skills.

Before writing any code, work together to produce a mockup on Figma. During this brainstorming and planning phase, talk through different ideas and do some light researching. *Remember*: changing a mockup is a lot faster than undoing and refactoring code.

## Notes!

There are also different ways to separate out tasks. You don't have to put 1 person entirely in charge of 1 page. You can have a team member in charge of styles across all pages or in charge of getting all images. Try to understand everyone's strengths and interests and shape your team according to that.

Your mockups are living documents. At each standup meeting, compare the code you've been able to write with the designs you had made and feel free to make changes if needed. This can happen if, for example, something is too hard / impossible to do or if, while working on the code, you think a different way would be better. Make the changes on Figma so all of your team members know about it.

## Perspective

This is will be our largest project to date, in a number of ways. We are using a lot of different technologies and skillsets:

- HTML
- CSS
- Project Management
- design docs
- git

This is also our first multi-file project with multiple engineers working simultaneously and our first project with coding light responsibilities. This is a taste of what our future projects will be like and also what your internships / jobs will probably feel like also.
