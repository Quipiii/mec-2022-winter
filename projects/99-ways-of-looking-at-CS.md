# TTP 2022 Winter Project 5: 99 Ways of Looking at CS

## Purpose

To pull together all of the skills that we have learned so far and integrate them into a single project.

To begin to understand and practice project management skills.

## Task

As a team, you are going to build a brochure website for a branch of computer science. Choose something that interests all / most of your team members.

There needs to be **at least 1 html page per team member**, with each page focusing on a particular aspect of that branch. Here are some suggestions for aspects to cover:

- History
- Current Developments
- Notable People Involved
- Real World Examples
- Sub Branches
- Intro Page with links to everything else

Create a single repo for all team members. Be sure to use branches to send updates.

Select one member of your team to act as the *project manager*. Their responsibility is to manage Pull Requests, track progress / obstacles, and host stand up meetings.

## Note

This is will be our largest project to date, in a number of ways. We are using a lot of different technologies and skillsets:

- HTML
- CSS
- Project Management
- git

This is also our first multi-file project with multiple engineers working simultaneously. This is a taste of what our future projects will be like and also what your internships / jobs will probably feel like also.
