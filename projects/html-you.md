# TTP 2022 Winter Project 3: HTML You

## Purpose

To practice fundamental skills with HTML.

## Task

Create a single HTML file named `index.html`. Use some of the basic HTML elements like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, and `<ol>` to build an informational page about you.

Who are you? What are you interested in? What are your goals and dreams? Whom do you wish were your mentors? Where have you lived?etc etc.

After we learn about `html attributes`, add `<a>` and `<img>` tags as well.

## Submission
