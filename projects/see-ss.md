# TTP 2022 Winter Project 4: See SS

## Purpose

To practice writing CSS rules along with CSS class and id selectors.

## Task

Fork another student's HTML You project. Then, help them out by spicying it up with CSS.

Start by adding a `<style>` tag inside the `<head>` tag. Then, add `id` and `class` attributes to their existing tags inside of `<body>` so that you can style them with CSS rules.

**Don't** add any new HTML tags for them. Work with what you got!

**However** you can add new `<div>` tags around their code, in order to group them better. Sometimes, it makes more sense to apply CSS rules to a single parent element rather than to apply the same CSS rules to multiple child elements.

## Submission

Submit it via our Airtable link here:

Since this is an individual project, you should only have to tag yourself.
